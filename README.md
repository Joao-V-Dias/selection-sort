# Selection Sort

Selection Sort é um algoritmo de ordenação simples que organiza os elementos de um array por meio da seleção repetida do menor valor restante e sua troca com o elemento da posição atual. A cada iteração, o menor valor da parte não ordenada da lista é movido para sua posição correta, no início da estrutura, construindo progressivamente a parte ordenada do array.

Na Otimização do codígo, apenas adicionamos a flag `sorted`

```python
def selectionSort(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    cont = 0
    vtTest = []
    for i in range(n):
        minIndex = i
        sorted = True
        for j in range(i+1, n ):
            if lst[j] < lst[minIndex]:
                minIndex = j
            if lst[j] < lst[j - 1]:
                sorted = False
            cont += 1
        lst[i], lst[minIndex] = lst[minIndex], lst[i]
        vtTest.append(lst[i])
        print(f"{vtTest}  |  {lst[i + 1:]}")
        if sorted:
            break

    execution_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    print(f"-> Tempo: {execution_time:.5f} segundos")
    print(f"-> Quantidade de iteracoes: {cont}")
    return lst
```

Ela verifica se o elemento anterior é maior que o atual, caso isso ocorra, a flag será definida como `False`, impedindo a execução do `break`. Se todas as comparações forem realizadas sem que nenhum elemento menor que o anterior seja encontrado, isso indica que o array está ordenado, permitindo encerrar o loop antecipadamente.

### Resultado - Comparação entre as duas versões (Iterações / Tempo em segundos)


| Lista 1       | Lista 2         | Lista 3           |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| 45 / 0.00001 | 4950 / 0.00026 | 499500 / 0.06651 |
| 39 / 0.00001 | 945 / 0.00009  | 495129 / 0.06415 |

Obtivemos uma redução na quantidade de iterações, o que resultou em um ganho no tempo de execução do algoritmo
